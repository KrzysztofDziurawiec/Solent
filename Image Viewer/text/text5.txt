KTM RC8R
Unashamedly a circuit-based blaster that will need a road-rider to be fully aware of 
what he is about to buy if it’s to be used on the road. From the competition-biased WP 
suspension to the 170bhp engine and the lightweight Marchesini wheels in between, the 
KTM RC8R cries out for corners to be taken at speed. Although it doesn’t need to be 
ridden hard to appreciate it. But when it is given its head the rewards are, possibly, 
the same as narcotics. KTM RC8-R in a sentence: styled to be different; made to please.
