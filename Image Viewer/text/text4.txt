HONDA CBR1000RR FIREBLADE
Honda has given Fireblade fans a reason to smile. With its classy Öhlins suspension, 
Brembo monobloc brakes, blueprinted engine and drop-dead gorgeous HRC paintjob,
the SP is the most desirable Blade in its 21-year history. With its improved handling, 
braking performance and grip, the SP is destined to be a faster-lapping, 
easier-to-handle track daybike than any previous model. And all the sexy bits make it a 
far better road bike, too, thanks to its smoother engine, plusher suspension, stronger 
brakes and taller double-bubble screen.
