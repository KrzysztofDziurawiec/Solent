MV-AGUSTA F4 1000RR CORSACORTA
It’s the most powerful and refined F4 MV Agusta has ever produced. Making a claimed 
201bhp at the crank, it just pips the ZX-10R’s 200.1bhp crank figure to make the Italian 
beauty the mostpowerful 2011 road-going superbike. It has a new short-stroke engine 
(hence the Corsacorta tag) with an exhaust note to die for, traction control, Ohlins 
suspension, an adjustable chassis, lightweight wheels and Brembo monobloc calipers.
It’s stilla heavy machine, doesn’t have the agility or friendliness of its rivals and its 
traction control isn’t up there with the Aprilia, BMW and Kawasaki systems. But ridden in 
isolation it’s fantastically fast, the Ohlins provides light steering and a beautiful ride and 
the Brembo brakes are proper racing grade. The test bike we rode at the Adria circuit in 
Italy had a pronounced flat spot around 9-10,000rpm, but MV say this could be an 
isolated problem with the electronically-operated inlet trumpets.
