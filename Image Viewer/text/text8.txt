BMW K1300R
It may look largely the same as the outgoing model but the latest version of BMW’s naked 
K1300R has had a host of small changes that add up to a much better bike all-round. 
With a claimed 173bhp and some seriously clever optional electronically-adjustable 
suspension, traction control and a long list of options to choose from, BMW has built a 
bike that almost defies naked bike logic. And don’t forget the new K-series range now has 
proper indicators rather than the confusing triple switches of old.
