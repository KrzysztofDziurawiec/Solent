BIMOTA BB3
One of the lightest and most powerful bikes ever. But on the track it comes up a little 
short. The tyres aren't great and it really isn't worth the extra £10,000 over the 2014
S1000RRit shares so many parts with.
It's a brave attempt for Bimota and looks fantastic but there a few rough edcges that are 
hard to overlook on something costing so much.
