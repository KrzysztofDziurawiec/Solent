DUCATI STREETFIGHTER 1100S
The Ducati Streetfighter looks like a crashed 1098 superbike but packs so much 
presence and attitude it works standing still. It needs to because at £13,995 
for the S-version we rode here, it has a hell of a lot of competition on its 
hands in one of the biggest-growing classes in the UK. 
Ducati claim it’s the lightest bike in the class, at 167kg (17kg lighter than the S4Rs 
it replaces) and it’s also the most powerful Ducati naked bike ever made. It’s a 
liquid-cooled, 155bhp V-twin bruiser that uses a hybrid 1098/1198 motor, a modified 
frame for more stability and a slightly longer swingarm. Think of it a cross between 
a big supermoto and a Monster and you’ll be on the right track.
