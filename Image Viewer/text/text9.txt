ARIEL ACE
Ariel has more recently been known for producing quirky-looking space-framed 
Atom sports cars with fearsome power to weight ratios and superbike levels of 
acceleration. But now they’re back making bikes. The Ace is a modular concept, 
so you can have any style you want from the cruiser shown here, to a super naked. 
Build quality is superb, it comes with a Honda V4 soundtrack to die for and has 
scintillating performance.  It’s the best bike Honda never made.
