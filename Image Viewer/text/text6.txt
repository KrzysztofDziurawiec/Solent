BMW S1000RR SPOR
You might have to squint to tell the difference between the old and new one (the new 
tail unit and higher swingarm pivot is the clue), but the 2012 S1000RR is a giant 
leap forward. The first S1000RR was already leagues ahead of the competition, thanks 
to its huge power and cutting-edge electronics, but BMW has improved their 
fire-breathing superbike in every area. Thanks to a host of small, but important mods, 
it has more grunt, a smoother power delivery, quicker steering, better suspension and 
more refined electronics. Never has 195bhp been so easy to control.
