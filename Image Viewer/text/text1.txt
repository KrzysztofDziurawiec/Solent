DUCATI 1199 PANIGALE R
This is a bike for two types of people: the well-healed Ducati collector, or a race 
team owner who will strip it down and compete in Superstock 1000 championships. 
Acceleration is slightly more urgent out of the corners,but essentially the Panigale 
R feels and handles the same as the base model, S or Tricolore. It is, of course, a 
spectacular creation, exhilarating to ride and will hopefully allow the Panigale to 
be a force to be reckonedwith in racing. It’s not like SP or R-model Ducati 
superbikes of old, where you’d get a much higher level of spec than the cooking 
models, but it is still one of the most capable superbikes ever build
